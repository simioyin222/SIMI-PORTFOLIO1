    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is <em>Similoluwa Oyinkolade</em>, but people usually call me
      Simi. What's really important to know about me is that I moved to Chicago
      not too long ago and I'm loving it so far! I'm a full-time streamer and
      content creator and I enjoy a lot of other things within those ranges as
      well. Currently, I'm working towards becoming a software engineer/video
      game developer. My time at Epicodus has been good so far and I'm hopeful
      for more positive experiences on this long road ahead.
